This project uses JavaScript combined with the face-api.js library for real-time face detection and comparison. Here's an overview of how it works based on the code:

Technology Used
JavaScript: Core language for implementing functionality.
face-api.js: A machine learning library built on top of TensorFlow.js that provides pre-trained models for face detection, landmark detection, face recognition, and more.
How Face Detection and Comparison Work

1. Face Detection:
- Models like tinyFaceDetector, ssdMobilenetv1, and faceLandmark68Net are preloaded using face-api.js.
- The system integrates with a webcam to capture real-time video streams.
- Faces in the video stream are detected using the detectAllFaces method, which identifies faces and marks their landmarks (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).

2. Face Descriptor Extraction:
- Each detected face is processed to generate a descriptor, which is a numerical representation of key facial features.
- Pre-uploaded images of individuals are also processed to generate descriptors, which are then labeled (e.g., a person's name).

3. Face Matching:
- Detected face descriptors are compared against the labeled descriptors using the FaceMatcher class from face-api.js.
- A similarity threshold determines if a match is found, and the matched label (e.g., a name) is displayed on the video stream.

4. Image Upload and Labeling:
- Users can upload images via a form, where each image is labeled with the uploader's name.
- The server saves these images and updates a JSON file (imageList.json) with metadata such as filenames and labels.

5. Real-time Comparison:
- The FaceMatcher continuously compares faces detected in the webcam feed with stored descriptors.
- Matching results are displayed on a canvas overlay, showing bounding boxes around faces and their corresponding labels.

This setup allows for seamless real-time face detection and identification by leveraging modern machine learning techniques in JavaScript.
